================================
OIDC connection
================================
1. Created a App registration
2. Configured Federated credentials, added GitHub details like organization name, repo name, branch name.
3. IN subscription, in IAM; gave a contributor role to this app.
- app registration and federated creds are so that GitHub actions can authenticate with the azure account. 
- BUT attaching IAM contributor role give this app registration the rights to create infra in the specified subscription,
we can attach roles subscription based or resource group based. 
4. Created a auth.yaml a temp workflow to check the connection which fetched the Azure Account ID successfully.

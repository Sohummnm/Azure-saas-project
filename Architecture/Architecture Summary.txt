Architecture: 
1. User External traffic
2. Admin Access[Ops/devops]
3. Private Resources[AKS-->ACR/Blob/Keyvault]
4. Internal Traffic[Clouds secure service-to-service(like mtls in k8s)]
5. Monitoring [AKS-LogAnalytics-AzureMonitor]

1. 🌍 External Traffic (User → Workloads)
- User request → Route 53 (DNS resolve) → Azure Traffic Manager (failover/load balancing).
- Traffic Manager → Application Gateway (WAF enabled, TLS termination) → AKS ingress.
- Purpose: Secure entry point for external users, with DNS + failover + WAF protection.

2. 🔑 Admin Access
- Ops team → Bastion → AKS nodes (private secure SSH/RDP).
- Bastion provides controlled, audited access to VMs/nodes inside the VNET.
- Purpose: Isolate admin access from user traffic, enforce least privilege.

3. 🔒 Private Resources (AKS dependencies)
- AKS → Azure Firewall (via UDR) → Private endpoints for:
- ACR (container images).
- Key Vault (secrets, certificates).
- Blob Storage (data, artifacts).
- Purpose: Ensure AKS workloads consume critical services securely, with traffic contained inside Azure backbone.

4. 🌐 Internal Traffic (Cloud services ↔ services)
- Azure DNS Private Zones resolve private endpoints.
- WAF → APIM → App Gateway → AKS for internal API calls.
- Used by other Azure services, enterprise apps, or governance layers.
- Purpose: Secure, governed communication between Azure services, excluding AKS’s direct dependencies.

5. 📊 Monitoring
- AKS → Log Analytics → Azure Monitor.
- Collects logs, metrics, and telemetry for observability.
- Purpose: Centralized monitoring, alerting, and compliance reporting.

✅ Summary
- External Traffic User → Entry path for customers.
- Admin Access → Secure ops access via Bastion.
- Private Resources → AKS dependencies (images, secrets, storage).
- Internal Traffic → Service-to-service flows inside Azure (APIM, WAF, DNS).
- Monitoring → Observability and compliance.
